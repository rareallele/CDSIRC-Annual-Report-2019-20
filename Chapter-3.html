                            The <i>Children and Young People (Oversight and Advocacy Bodies) Act 2016</i> articulates the role and functions of the Committee, and empowers it to obtain information about a case of child death or serious injury from any person (whether or not the person is a state authority, or an officer or employee of a state authority). Using this power, the Committee receives information regarding the death of a child from a range of sources and uses this information in its determinations.

                        <p>
                            The Committee acquires the publicly available number of children and young people resident across the dimensions of calendar year, single year of age, sex, cultural background, and postcode from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The ABS provides this information, as well as the estimated resident population, in its five-yearly Census of Population and Housing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the purpose of this report, the population of children and young people resident in South Australia by calendar year, single year of age, sex, cultural background, and postcode is interpolated as follows: the counts across single year of age, sex, cultural background and postcode are taken from the census, and assigned to the calendar years as three years before each census to two years after the census. The multiplier needed to get from the census to the estimated resident population for each year is found and then applied to each of the 369,360 cells in the matrix calendar year (15 levels), age (18 levels), sex (2 levels), cultural background (2 levels), and postcode (342 levels). The multiplier is found by dividing the estimated resident population by the census count, and is performed separately for the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations. Note that when re-aggregated, the adjusted count is the same as the estimate resident population.

                        <p>
                            Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) is a product developed by the ABS that ranks areas in Australia according to relative socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage. The indexes are based on information from the five-yearly census.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the purpose of this report, the Committee used the Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD). The postcode of the usual residence of each child or young person who died was matched to the appropriate SEIFA/IRSD level extracted from the census nearest their year of death. Deciles were collapsed into quintiles: on this scale, quintile 1 includes areas with the greatest relative socioeconomic disadvantage and quintile 5 includes areas with the least relative socioeconomic disadvantage.

                        <p>
                            The Committee receives information regarding the death of a child or young person in South Australia from three government sources: Births, Deaths and Marriages; the State Coroner’s Court; and the Pregnancy Outcome Unit. The count of deaths in this annual report includes all cases received from these sources with the following exceptions:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>if the Committee understands from the information gathered that the case was a termination of pregnancy</li>
                            <li>if the Committee understands that the death occurred after the birth of an infant, prior to 20 weeks gestation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Where there is disagreement between the sources, the Committee reviews all of the available evidence to arrive at a conclusion.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            To differentiate grouping, the ABS uses the categories of ‘Aboriginal’, ‘Torres Strait Islander’, ‘Both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’, ‘Not stated’ and ‘Non-Indigenous’. For the purpose of this report, the Committee collapses these categories into two groups: ‘Aboriginal = ‘Aboriginal’, ‘Torres Strait Islander’, ‘Both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’; and ‘Other’ = ‘Not stated’ and ‘Non-Indigenous’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is important to note that the Committee’s determination of the cultural background of a deceased child or young person uses multiple administrative sources, and is a different methodology than that used by the ABS which is based on the self-report of the person completing the census form. There are good reasons to think that these are different<sup><a href="#fn-16">16</a></sup>.

                        <p>The definition used to determine inclusion as the death of a child or young person aged 1 to 17 years with disability is:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the child or young person was over one year of age at the time of death</li>
                            <li>the child or young person’s daily activities were limited due to their disability, illness, disease or health problem; and </li>
                            <li>the child or young person’s daily activities were adversely affected for a period of six months or more.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Where the length of time during which the child or young person’s daily activities were adversely affected was unknown, the case was not included on the register. Cases where the child or young person had a chronic health condition (eg, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes) were only included on the register if other disabilities were present. Some children and young people have multiple types of disability, for example cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Multiple disabilities are recorded for each child or young person, where identified.

                            <p>
                                There is a unique set of challenges associated with identifying disability in infants. A set of criteria has been developed by the Committee to identify the deaths of infants with a disability. Deaths are excluded from consideration if the underlying cause is: prematurity alone; prematurity and maternal factors; infection; haemorrhage; digestive or respiratory problems; cancer; heart disease, including myocarditis and cardiomyopathy; or, congenital malformations of major organs such as heart, kidney and liver.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once these cases are excluded, the remaining deaths are then reviewed by the Disability Special Interest Group, and a decision made about inclusion in the Disability Register based on the available information. Multiple types of disability are not recorded for infants under one year of age.

                            To be included in this section of the report, the child, young person, or a member of their family must have had some form of contact with DCP or its predecessors within three years of the incident resulting in their death. The guardianship status of a child, young person, or their parent(s) is determined during this process, whether in South Australia or in another Australian state or territory.

                    <h3>3.4. In-depth review process</h3>
                    <p>Deaths screened by the Committee are assigned one of the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Eligible for review – a case will only be considered eligible for review under Section 37(2) of the Act, if the incident resulting in the death or serious injury occurred in the state; or the child or young person was, at the time of their death or serious injury, ordinarily resident in the state.</li>
                        <li>Not for review – a case may not require in-depth review if the screening of information available at the time indicated that there are no systemic issues arising from the death. These cases are assigned a category of death, eg, illness or disease, SUDI, transport, deliberate acts etc, and the details are kept on the Committee’s database. They are included in the relevant annual report. They may be included in reviews in later years, where features from cases aggregated over a number of years suggest that there may be systemic issues that can be addressed.</li>
                        <li>Pending further information – in some cases the Committee requests further information before making a decision regarding in-depth review. </li>
                        <li>Pending completion of investigations – in accordance with Section 37(4) of the Act, the Committee must not undertake a review if there is a risk that the review would compromise an ongoing criminal investigation, and must wait until coronial investigations are complete. </li>
                        <li>Awaiting assignment – in any reporting year, there are also cases ready for review but awaiting assignment to a ‘review team’. The number of cases pending investigation or review gradually decreases during any year as information is obtained, cases are finalised in the criminal and coronial systems, and the Committee makes a determination about further review.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3.5. Reporting requirements</h3>
                    <p>
                        Section 39 of the Act outlines the reporting responsibilities of the Committee. It requires the Committee to report periodically to the Minister for Education, and also to provide an annual report on the performance of its statutory functions for the preceding financial year. The Committee submits a report to the Minister for Education at the conclusion of each in-depth review. The report contains the Committee’s recommendations about systemic or legislative issues that may contribute to the prevention of similar deaths or serious injuries.
